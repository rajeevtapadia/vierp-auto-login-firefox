# VIERP and VOLP Auto Login extension for firefox

## What it does?
Saves your lazy ass from typing the same credentials over and over again. 

---

## How to use?

- Install it from [firefox add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vierp-auto-login/) (if the Firefox gods approve it—fingers crossed)
- Edit: well they didn't approve so [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4402439/ec8652a20ca446899678-1.0.xpi) we go (open link in firefox)
- Click the icon, enter your email (vit.edu, obviously), and password (quick PSA: your VIERP and VOLP passwords must match, don’t overthink it).
- Open [VIERP](https://learner.vierp.in/) or [VOLP](https://classroom.volp.in/login)
- Enjoy

## Why Trust Me With You Login Credentials?
1. I promise I couldn’t care less about your assignments or attendance records.
2. Your credentials are stored locally and securely (just dont check the src code ;)

#### It only works on VIERP and VOLP nothing else

ps: support for https://tpo.vierp.in/ was intentionally not added as you should not be giving tpo account password to random ass extensions
